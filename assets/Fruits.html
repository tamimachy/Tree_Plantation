				<h3> Apple </h3>
				<p> Apple come in all shades of reds, green, yellows. 7500 varieties of apples are grown
				throughout the world.  Apples are fat, sodium, and cholesterol free. A medium apple is about 80
				calories. Apple are a great source of the fibre pectin. One apple has five grams of fibre. 25 
				percent of an apple’s volume is air. That is why they float. Apples ripen six to ten times faster
				at room temperature than if they were refrigerated. The old saying,“ an apple a day, keeps the
				doctor away.” This saying comes from an old English adage.“ To eat an apple before going bad,
				will make the doctor beg this bread.” Don’t peel your apple. Two-third of the fibre and lots of
				antioxidant are found in the peel Antioxidant help to reduce damage to cells which can trigger
				some diseases.

				<div class="banana">
				<h3> Banana </h3>
				<p> Bananas are a good source of vitamin C, potassium and dietary fibre. Bananas have no fat,
				cholesterol or sodium. Bananas are great for athletic and fitness activity because they replenish
				necessary carbohydrates, glycogen and body fluids burned during exercise. Bananas are available
				all year-round. They are harvested every day of the year. The bananas industry in Australia is
				well over 100 years old. A cluster of bananas is called a hand and consists of 10 to 20 bananas,
				which are known as fingers. When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice
				the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the
				other vitamins and minerals. Queensland grower Pacific Coast Eco-Bananas has registered the
				colour red-applied as a wax on up to a third of the fruit as a trademark. The grower hopes to
				become the only grower allowed to use the colour to distinguish and promote its bananas in
				Australia. It is believed to be the first colour trademark registered for fresh fruit.

				<div class="grape">
				<h3> Grape </h3>
				<p> Grapes were first cultivated over 8000 years ago. Grapes with black skins are dried to make
				raisins, whereas sultanas are dried from small seedless green grapes. Americans call all dried
				grapes ‘raisins’. There are many hundreds of varieties of grapes but the favourites are: </p>
				<p> Green- Thomson seedless, Waltham Cross and Menindee Seedless. </p>
				<p> Purple/Pink- Muscat, Purple Cornichon, Ribiers, Black Muscat, Flame Seedless and Red Globe.
				</p>
				<p> Grapes have a high sugar content with half as glucose and half as fructose. Grapes also
				contribute some dietary fibre and vitamin C. Grapes also contain adequate amounts of potassium
				and vitamin A and are low in sodium. </p>

				<div class="mango">
				<h3> Mango </h3>
				<p> Mangoes are known as the king of Fruits. A mango tree doesn’t produce fruit until it’s about
				four years old. Mangoes are picked when mature and more green than yellow. Mangoes belong to the
				same family as the cashew and the pistachio nut. Mangoes are eaten green in parts of Asia, often
				sprinkled with a mixture of salt and sugar. Mangoes are now grown in most tropical countries and
				are abundant in the northern parts of Australia. In Australia- the most common mango is
				Kensington Pride or Bowen Special. Mangoes are an excellent source of vitamin C, beta carotene
				and other related carotenoids. The deeper the colour of the flesh, the higher the carotenoid
				level. Mangoes also supply some dietary fibre.

				<div class="orange">
				<h3> Orange </h3>
				<p>One orange supplies a healthy dose of vitamin C, which plays an important role in cancer
				prevention, healthy blood circulation and wound healing. Oranges are a good source of the crucial
				B- vitamin folate, which is essential in preventing birth defects and fighting heart disease.
				Oranges provide more than seven percent of the Daily Value for potassium, which is needed for
				proper fluid balance. Navel oranges are named that because of the belly- button formation
				opposite the stem end. The bigger the navel in an orange, the sweeter it will be. Oranges, as
				well as other fruits, contain a water-soluble fibre called pectin. Studies show that pectin helps
				reduce blood cholesterol levels. This may explain why individuals who eat several servings daily
				of fruits, such as oranges, and vegetables have a lower risk for heart diseases. Oranges are high
				in antioxidants, which neutralize the effects of free radicals, unstable oxygen molecules in your
				body, believed to cause aging and some diseases. After chocolate and vanilla, orange is the
				world’s favourite flavour.
